QR Codes in Healthcare Management:  A Framework for Improving NHS Efficiency &amp; Patient Satisfaction
This repository houses a research project focused on exploring the integration and effectiveness of Quick Response (QR) codes within the National Health Service (NHS) to enhance operational processes and patient experience. The project is grounded in a detailed examination of patient and staff perspectives on the use of QR codes for appointment management and hospital check-ins. Included in this repository are two survey datasets, which form the core of our empirical data collection. These surveys were meticulously designed to gather qualitative and quantitative insights from NHS users, shedding light on their experiences, preferences, and any concerns regarding the adoption of QR code technology in healthcare settings. Additionally, a Jupyter Notebook file is provided, containing the analysis of the collected data. This notebook details the methodology for data processing, analysis, and visualization, offering a comprehensive view of the research findings. Together, these resources encapsulate the depth of our investigation into leveraging QR codes to foster a more efficient, accessible, and patient-centric NHS.
